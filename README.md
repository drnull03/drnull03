I'm a passionate developer and researcher driven by the challenge of solving complex problems at the intersection of security, intelligence, and decentralization. My goal is to leverage technology to build a more secure, equitable, and transparent world.

My Core Interests & Focus:
Security Research I am interested in uncovering vulnerabilities and designing robust systems to protect digital assets and privacy.


My Philosophy:<br/>
I believe in the power of code to be a force for good. Every project I undertake is guided by a simple mission: to leave the world a little better than I found it. Whether it's securing a protocol, building an open-source tool, or contributing to a community, I strive to make a positive impact.

Feel free to contact me on a problem you are having on one of my projects using this email address:
